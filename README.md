# Nanocoder

A local-first CLI coding agent that brings the power of agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to local models or controlled APIs like OpenRouter. Built with privacy and control in mind, Nanocoder supports multiple AI providers with tool support for file operations and command execution.

## Installation

### For Users (Recommended)

Install globally and use anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g @motesoftware/nanocoder
```

Then run in any directory:

```bash
nanocoder
```

### For Development

If you want to contribute or modify Nanocoder:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js 18+
- npm

**Setup:**

1. Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd nanocoder
npm install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Run locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

Or build and run in one command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

### AI Provider Setup

**Option A: Ollama (Local AI)**

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:0.6b  # or any other model
```

**Option B: OpenRouter (Cloud AI)**

Create `agents.config.json` in your **working directory** (where you run `nanocoder`):

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "openRouterApiKey": "your-api-key-here",
    "openRouterModels": ["foo-model", "bar-model"]
  }
}
```

**Option C: OpenAI-Compatible APIs (Local or Remote)**

Configure any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g., LM Studio, Ollama Web API, vLLM, LocalAI, etc.):

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "openAICompatible": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234",
      "apiKey": "optional-api-key",
      "models": ["model-1", "model-2"]
    }
  }
}
```

Common OpenAI-compatible providers:
- **LM Studio**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234"`
- **Ollama Web API**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434"`
- **vLLM**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000"`
- **LocalAI**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080"`
- **Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint**: Just provide the base URL

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

Nanocoder supports connecting to MCP servers to extend its capabilities with additional tools. Configure MCP servers in your `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "filesystem",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/directory"]
      },
      {
        "name": "github",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "custom-server",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["path/to/server.py"],
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When MCP servers are configured, Nanocoder will:
- Automatically connect to all configured servers on startup
- Make all server tools available to the AI model
- Show connected servers and their tools with the `/mcp` command

Popular MCP servers:
- **Filesystem**: Enhanced file operations
- **GitHub**: Repository management
- **Brave Search**: Web search capabilities
- **Memory**: Persistent context storage
- [View more MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

> **Note**: The `agents.config.json` file should be placed in the directory where you run Nanocoder, allowing for project-by-project configuration with different models or API keys per repository.

### Commands

#### Built-in Commands

- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/clear` - Clear chat history
- `/model` - Switch between available models
- `/provider` - Switch between AI providers (ollama/openrouter/openai-compatible)
- `/mcp` - Show connected MCP servers and their tools
- `/history` - Select from recent prompt history
- `/debug` - Toggle logging levels (silent/normal/verbose)
- `/commands` - List all custom commands
- `/exit` - Exit the application

#### Custom Commands

Nanocoder supports custom commands defined as markdown files in the `.nanocoder/commands` directory. This allows you to create reusable prompts with parameters and organize them by category.

**Example custom command** (`.nanocoder/commands/test.md`):
```markdown
---
description: "Generate comprehensive unit tests for the specified component"
aliases: ["testing", "spec"]
parameters:
  - name: "component"
    description: "The component or function to test"
    required: true
---

Generate comprehensive unit tests for {{component}}. Include:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and error handling
- Mock dependencies where appropriate
- Clear test descriptions
```

**Usage**: `/test component="UserService"`

**Features**:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata (description, aliases, parameters)
- Template variable substitution with `{{parameter}}` syntax
- Namespace support through directories (e.g., `/refactor:dry`)
- Autocomplete integration for command discovery
- Parameter validation and prompting

**Pre-installed Commands**:
- `/test` - Generate comprehensive unit tests for components
- `/review` - Perform thorough code reviews with suggestions
- `/refactor:dry` - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- `/refactor:solid` - Apply SOLID design principles
